## A Website Created for CS50W

I did this over multiple weeks, while travelling overseas, starting in the CS50IDE before finally managing to install GalliumOS on my Chromebook so I could use Atom and the Linux Terminal.

It is basically just fulfilling the requirements for the assignment.  

I could probably spend many hours trying to actually explain what I am trying to describe here, a view of the Universe which I have been thinking about most of my adult life; and I probably wouldn't get any closer to a satisfactory communication of my ideas.  But it was fun! Especially once I got Linux working and didn't have to push to github just to see every change I made to the html or css, since the IDE's viewer wasn't working at that time.
