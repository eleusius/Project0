                 From a Physics / Cosmology perspective, this idea answers the questions about the asymmetry of the Universe, such as -“Why is the Universe made only of matter (and not anti-matter)?” and “Why does time move only forward but not backwards?” - by arguing that the Universe expanded (and contracted, and remained static) from the Big Bang in a three-fold symmetry (plus the zero-dimensional singularity at the origin and terminus and pervading all of space-time) forward, backward, and both/neither in time, with matter, anti-matter, and something else altogether existing simultaneously in their own parallel planes of reality.

                 It uses Einstein’s idea of a fabric of space-time as the basis, rather than any sort of quantum field theory, and aspires to explain String Theory, without me knowing much beyond reading books such as those by Brian Greene.  It argues for a “world-sheet” which is continuous from the Big Bang to the Present Moment.  Any perturbations in this fabric of space-time, for example in the present moment in the “matter/forward time universe,” would have the opportunity to travel (in this example) “forward” in time, through the singularity (for example the black hole at the center of every galaxy), and then “backward” in time, such that the time dimensions nearly exactly cancel out and an equal-opposite perturbation would occur in the “backward time non-material universe” in a similar way to the simultaneity in “quantum entanglement” experiments. This sets the stage for a resurrection of the Cartesian body-mind duality which, for example, Buddhist philosophy still holds to be valid.
